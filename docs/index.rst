=================================
Welcome to Spykfunc documentation
=================================

Spykfunc is a new Functionalizer implementation on top of Spark (PySpark).

Functionalizer goal is to filter out synapse touches, produced by Touch
Detector, according to rules defined in the recipe. The resulting touches
can then be exported to a circuit format as expected by the simulator,
typically `syn2`, but also `nrn_*.h5`.
